Description: Calculates some antecedent discharge conditions useful in 
    water quality modeling. Includes methods for calculating flow anomalies, 
    base flow, and smooth discounted flows from daily flow measurements. 
    Antecedent discharge algorithms are described and reviewed in 
    <doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.12.052>.
